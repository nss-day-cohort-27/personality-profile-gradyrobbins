<!-- instructions:
    make your own site that describes your personality type that you discovered from 16personalities.com. Your site should have a single HTML page, with the following sections.

    General Profile Section: Three statements that you agree with. Three statements that you don't agree with, and why.
    People Like Me Section: 4 people that share your personality type.
    Comunication Section:
    How would I communicate best with my little sib.
    How would I like my instructors to communicate with me.
    How would I like my teammates to communicate with me
    Requirements
    You must create an object with three keys, each representing one of the sections. Store that object in local storage.
    Then when you write your application, read from local storage and use the data to build the three sections in your HTML.
    document.createElement()
    localStorage.getItem()
    You must use Flexbox to layout your page structure.
    You must push to Github and notify your lead instructor when you are done.
